# login-sound
Plays a login sound in the background in Solaris-based operating systems.
This modified version uses mpg123 rather than the usual ogg123 the linux/bsd version uses.

# System Requirements
To use login-sound, you will need to install mpg123, and a desktop environment that allows startup applications to be added.

# Installation
Clone the repo and run `sudo ./install.sh`
Omit sudo if root
